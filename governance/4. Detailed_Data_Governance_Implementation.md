# Practical Data Governance Implementation Plan

## 1. Data Quality Management
### Instructions
- Define and document validation rules within your Fabric Data Pipelines:
  - Use built-in data validation features to check data types, null values, and ranges.
  - Implement custom validations using dataflow expressions or scripts.
- Automate anomaly detection with scheduled data profiling jobs and alerts.
- Integrate quality checks as pre-requisites before data moves from staging to curated zones.

## 2. Security & Access Control
### Instructions
- Use Microsoft Fabric portal to create user roles:
  - Assign 'Data Uploader' role with write-access only to staging folders.
  - Assign 'Data Engineer' role with full access to pipelines and curated zones.
  - Assign 'Analyst' role with read-only permissions to curated tables.
- Configure storage encryption via Fabric settings.
- Store and manage credentials securely using Fabric secrets store or Azure Key Vault.

## 3. Data Lineage & Auditability
### Instructions
- Enable Fabric’s data lineage features in your workspace settings to auto-track datasets.
- Implement systematic logging within ingestion and transformation pipelines:
  - Capture upload timestamps, user IDs, file names.
  - Log pipeline start/end and record counts processed.
- Schedule periodic reviews of lineage reports for discrepancies.

## 4. Metadata Management
### Instructions
- Import and register datasets in Fabric Catalog:
  - Upload data dictionary CSV into Fabric catalog metadata.
  - Regularly update schema versions as pipeline evolves.
- Use tags and descriptions extensively to clarify dataset meaning.
- Link pipeline updates to metadata refresh to maintain accuracy.

## 5. Compliance & Privacy
### Instructions
- Identify PII columns from data dictionary.
- Implement masking functions within Fabric Dataflows:
  - Use hash or tokenization techniques for PII.
  - Apply role-based column masking to limit exposure.
- Define data retention policies and implement automated purge scripts.
- Conduct quarterly compliance audits and report findings.

## 6. Manual File Upload Governance
### Instructions
- Establish directory and naming standards:
  - Create staging folders in Fabric Lakehouse:
    - `/staging/session_data/`
    - `/staging/order_data/`
    - `/staging/product_data/`
    - `/staging/refund_data/`
  - Enforce file naming: `[data_type]_[YYYYMMDD]_[version].csv`
- Set user permissions strictly to control who can upload files.
- Implement alerts for new uploads via Fabric or external monitoring tools.
- Develop automated triggers to start data pipelines post-upload.

## 7. Automation and Monitoring
### Instructions
- Integrate GitHub Actions with Fabric pipelines for CI/CD:
  - Automate deployment of pipeline and policy configurations.
  - Run automated tests to verify data compliance post-deployment.
- Set up monitoring dashboards for pipeline health and data quality metrics.
- Configure alert notifications on pipeline failures or anomalies.

## 8. Documentation 
### Instructions
- Maintain comprehensive documentation on governance policies and workflows:
  - Use internal wiki or Fabric workspace docs.
