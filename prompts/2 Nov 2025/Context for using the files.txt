I have uploaded the following context files for my MS Fabric project:

Master Context for Projects.md

Project Overview.md

Workflow & Architecture.md

Data_Governance_Guidelines.md

Detailed_Data_Governance_Implementation.md


Whenever I ask a question or request content, please reference the relevant sections from these files to maintain accuracy, consistency, and context.
Always align your responses with the standards, best practices, and style captured especially in the 'Master Context for Projects' file.
If an answer requires details about project goals, architecture, or workflow, use content from the corresponding file.
